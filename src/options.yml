      Assume for logic purposes that you are playing on a file that has completed the 
      main play-through. This means you can access any stage with any combination of 
      partners, and access the Rhythm Tower.
      
      NOTE: IF YOU TURN THIS OFF, YOUR RANDOMIZER MIGHT BREAK!
      Archipelago logic assumes that a player can return to previously accessible 
      locations at any time. But Hi-Fi Rush does not allow access to previous levels 
      (or even previous checkpoints of levels you are on) until after you defeat Kale,
      which is the victory condition for the randomizer. So if you miss a check, you 
      may have to fudge picking up previous checks if they turn out to be important.

    hidden: false
    
  summon_rando:
    type: Toggle
    description: |
      Adds the ability to summon partners to the item pool. NOTE: The logic of this 
      randomizer only takes into account a partner's out of battle abilities. It does
      not care if you use partner abilities in-battle. This also results in the game
      being more non-linear, as several tracks can be at least entered without some
      partner summons.

  combo_rando:
    type: Toggle
    description: |
      Adds Chai's purchasable combos to the item pool. You can implement this restriction
      in your game by selling all of the moves at the store and purchasing them back when
      the randomizer grants them to you. 
    default: false
    group: Item Pool Options 
  special_rando:
    type: Toggle
    description: |
      Adds Chai's purchasable special attacks to the item pool. You can implement this 
      restriction in your game by either selling or just not equipping the purchasable
      special attacks. Power Chord is always available.
      NOTE: The logic does not account for needing to pick up the special attacks 
      (eg, the comic book items in the world) on the first play-through.
    default: false

  chip_rando:
    type: Toggle
    description: |
      Adds Chai's purchasable chips to the item pool. You can implement this restriction
      in your game by simply limiting what chips you can equip. Chip levels are progressive.
