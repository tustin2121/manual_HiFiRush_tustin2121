      How to end your play-through:
      defeat kale - Win the game by defeating Kale in Track 12.
      defeat track 11 - Win the game by completing Track 11, which is easier than fighting Kale.

      Assume for logic purposes that you are playing on a file that has completed the 
      main play-through. This means you can access any stage with any combination of 
      partners.
      
      NOTE: IF YOU TURN THIS OFF, YOUR RANDOMIZER MIGHT BREAK!
      Archipelago logic assumes that a player can return to previously accessible 
      locations at any time. But Hi-Fi Rush does not allow access to previous levels 
      (or even previous checkpoints of levels you are on) until after you defeat Kale,
      which is the victory condition for the randomizer. So if you miss a check, you 
      may have to fudge picking up previous checks if they turn out to be important.
